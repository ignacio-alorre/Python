# Dictionaries

```python
# Unordered collections, garantee there are no duplicates in that collection, can take key value pairs. Values are not accessed by an index, but by means of a key

fruit = {"orange": "a sweet citrus",
         "apple": "good for making cider",
         "lemon": "an acid citrus",
         "grape": "a small sweet fruit"}
         
print(fruit['orange'])  # "a sweet citrus"

```

# Set

```python
# Unordered collections, garantee there are no duplicates in that collection, intended to store similar items but you can't acctually access individual items using an index (since sets are unordered index is meaningless in this context)
```
